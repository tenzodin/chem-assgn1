                    Electrochemistry stands as a cornerstone in chemistry, exploring the intricate interplay between chemical reactions and electricity. At its core lie electrochemical cells, where chemical energy is converted into electrical energy, or vice versa. These cells consist of two electrodes—an anode and a cathode—immersed in an electrolyte solution. Redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions are fundamental to electrochemistry, where oxidation occurs at the anode, leading to electron loss, and reduction takes place at the cathode, with electron gain. This electron flow drives the electrochemical process, enabling the generation of electric current. Electrolysis, a key application, utilizes electrical energy to drive non-spontaneous reactions, commonly employed in metal extraction and electroplating processes. Conversely, galvanic cells, such as batteries, spontaneously convert chemical energy into electrical energy, exploiting potential differences between half-cells. The electrochemical series aids in predicting redox reactions' direction and the feasibility of electrochemical processes by ranking substances based on their standard electrode potentials. With applications spanning from energy storage in batteries to corrosion prevention, electroplating, and clean energy production in fuel cells, electrochemistry plays an indispensable role in various scientific and industrial domains, shaping modern technological advancements.
